# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt super laborious... But also very satisfying and fun. It was frustrating at times but in the end it was a good learning experience. Taught me a lot about coding and about myself, I enjoyed it very much.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Workflow is going well, these last few days have definitely been better than the ones before and the ones before that! I'm noticing that I'm getting more and more in tune with that part as time passes. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learned that early birds get worms and that the best strategy for me is tackling the job ASAP and being resilient, as well as asking for help from my peers. I want to store everything in the exercise in my coding brain for sure because I know it's only the beginning, and the start of my foundation.
